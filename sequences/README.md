# Sequences
This folder contains cached arrival sequences used in the experiments. When running experiments, the code first checks if a cached sequence file exists for the requested distribution and parameters. If found, it loads and uses the cached data immediately. If not found, it generates new sequences and saves them to this folder for future runs, ensuring reproducibility and avoiding redundant computation.

## Using Custom Sequences

You can add your own arrival sequences by creating `.npz` files with the following format.

Each `.npz` file contains:
- Arrivals: NumPy array of shape `(trials, n)` where each row represents one trial containing n arrival times.
- Metadata: JSON string containing generation parameters:
  - `distribution`: Distribution type (MAWI, Pareto, or Poisson).
  - `n`: Number of arrivals per sequence.
  - `trials`: Number of independent trials.
  - `seed`: Random seed used for generation.
  - Distribution-specific parameters (e.g., `alpha`, `scale`, `target_mean`).
 

## MAWI Dataset

The included MAWI sequence was generated by sampling from real network traffic traces provided on the [MAWI website](https://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/). To regenerate the MAWI sequences:

- Download the `.pcap.gz` file from [MAWI Traffic Archive](https://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/samplepoint-F/2025/202501011400.html).
- Decompress the file.
  
  MacOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   gunzip 202501011400.pcap.gz
   ```
   
  Windows:
  ```bash
   tar -xzf 202501011400.pcap.gz
   ```
  
This will create a `.pcap` file ready to use with the script. Move it to the same folder as `acknowledgment.py`.
