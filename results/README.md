# Results

This folder contains experimental outputs generated by `acknowledgment.py`: CSV files with numerical data and PDF files with plots.

## CSV File Format

Each CSV file has 50 rows representing error levels from 0 to 1.5, with the following columns:

- error_level: Prediction error η (0 = perfect predictions, higher = worse predictions).
- classic: Performance ratio of Classic Deterministic algorithm (λ=1, no predictions).
- trust: Performance ratio of Trust algorithm (λ=0, fully trusts predictions).
- ack_each: Performance ratio of ACK-after-each baseline.
- fixed_time: Performance ratio of fixed-time-ACK baseline.
- lambda_0_05, lambda_0_1, lambda_0_2, lambda_0_4, lambda_0_6, lambda_0_8: Performance ratios of Augmented algorithm with various λ parameters.

All values are performance ratios with 6 decimal places. A value of 1.0 means optimal performance; higher values indicate worse performance.
